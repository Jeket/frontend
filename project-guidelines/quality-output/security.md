The security of the project always used to be a thing considered to be done on the backend. But there is almost the same amount of vulnerabilities present on the frontend. Especially with Single Page Applications, where you often deal with sensitive data.

ESLint is covering your back for many security issues. But the best way to protect yourself is to know what kind of attacks could happen. [Hacksplaining.com](https://www.hacksplaining.com) is a great resource to learn how to perform attacks and especially how to prevent them.
