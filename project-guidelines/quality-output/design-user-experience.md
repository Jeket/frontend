# Design & User Experience

As frontend developers, we are responsible for the end-user experience. We are implementing designs, creating animations or setting up validation rules for forms. There are numerous responsibilities we have.

## Responsive Web Design

Have an attention to detail.Do a mobile first design. And always think about edge-cases. Doing a perfect responsive web app takes some time and a lot of testing. Don’t underestimate real device testing. It’s the one which can provide you the most valuable feedback.

Typically, apps are supposed to be optimized for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop. Today, there are too many different devices with different screen sizes. You should ideally cover some most typical devices like iPhones or Samsung/Android.

## Accessibility

Accessibility takes your website on another level. It is accessible to all types of users, which should be always a preferred way.

If designs, you are working with, have accessibility issues, you should address them to designer and if that is not possible, address it to any other stakeholder.

## Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps are just like a normal web, but with superpowers.

Progressive web apps are designed to work on any browser that is compliant with web standards. As with other cross-platform solutions, the goal is to help developers build cross-platform apps more easily than they would with native apps. [According to Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), the characteristics of a PWA are:

- Progressive— Works for every user, regardless of browser choice, using progressive enhancement principles.
- Responsive— Fits on any device: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever comes next.
- Performant — Scrolling is smooth. Quick response time. Rapid caching. Running on 60ps.
- Network independent— Service workers allow offline usage, or on low-quality network connections
- App-like— Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation.
- Fresh— Always up-to-date due to the service worker update process.
- Safe— Served via HTTPS to prevent security issues
- Discoverable — Identifiable as an “application” by manifest.json and service worker registration, and discoverable by search engines.
- Re-engageable— Ability to use push notifications to maintain engagement with the user.
- Installable— Provides homescreen icons without the use of an App Store.
- Linkable — Can easily be shared via a URL, and does not require complex installation.
