# Quality Assurance

It's always handy to have an extra pair of eyes to check your output. In STRV, we have a dedicated QA team for each project.

Besides whenever you are working on a project for a long time, you are getting a [tunnel vision](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_vision_(metaphor)>), which results in not seeing obvious bugs.

Having QA in a team on larger projects is not just nice to have, but actually very important and mandatory.

Itâ€™s not the responsibility of the developer to lobby having QA engineers on the project. But since we are here to build a successful product, this could be a really nice recommendation to your client. In the end, everybody wants to have a bugless beautifully working app. So why not try it out?
