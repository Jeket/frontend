# SEO, SMO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a well-known term in frontend development. Itâ€™s all about metatags, descriptions, titles and semantic markup.

Less known SMO stands for Social Media Optimization. You can think of any social network (the most common are Facebook and Twitter), where your users can share your website. You need to set-up appropriate meta tags for these networks too.
