# Static type checking

[Type checking](../project-setup/static-type-checking.md) has quite the same story \(of being mentioned above in the Project Setup chapter\) and importance just like testing mentioned above.

Type checking besides guarding your types is also great for better developer experience \(better IntelliSense, code analysis\). You can also autogenerate types \(for example from GraphQL schemas\). Doing refactoring is much easier.

Your workflow is much more efficient with typing. Even though it takes some time to get used to it.
