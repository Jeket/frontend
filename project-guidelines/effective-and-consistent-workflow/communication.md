# Communication

Communication is the key to success. It’s a well-known rule applicable not just in frontend development, but pretty much anywhere. Be transparent, share updates, notice about blockers. And be nice! In the end, the tone of voice can change a lot of circumstances.

It’s a good practice to share with your team a small written standup, describing what have you done today, what are you planning to do tomorrow and if there is any blocker preventing you from performing your job. It’s not bad to do even when you work alone on a project.

Besides written communication, there is also a verbal one. Learn how to speak. How to outstand unpleasant calls. Sometimes clients are coming with silly requests. You must be on top, be professional.
