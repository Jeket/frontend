# Testing

[The importance of tests](../project-setup/testing.md) was already described in the Project Setup chapter. If you are about to make your workflow effective and consistent, you should definitely start writing tests.

It’s very useful investment, which besides guarding your code quality and helping you shipping new versions without bugs, also helps you during the refactoring.

It’s crucial to have tests especially when you are coming back to the project after some time. You just don’t remember some stuff. And tests could serve you as documentation.

Usually, the absence of meaningful tests makes it almost impossible to take over somebody else’s codebase. If you do so, you will have a bad velocity on a project. And you won’t be sure if you won’t break anything by any change in code.
