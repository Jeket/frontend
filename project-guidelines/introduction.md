# INTRODUCTION

Frontend development includes more and more responsibilities for its developers. There are almost unlimited sources of knowledge online. Yet none of them reflects the current status quo we believe in. From the high-level perspective there are three main aspects that matter:

* The Project Setup
* Effective and Consistent Workflow
* The Quality Output

All three of them work nicely together and almost canâ€™t live one without another. Thus we decided to make them as main chapters and focus on smaller areas in each chapter. Some information could be repetitive or just crossed-referenced with each other.

Please note that our knowledge is highly opinionated. For frontend development, we use almost exclusively React. And as the main Code Versioning System, we use GitHub. There are numerous great alternatives. But this kind of information is more suitable for another document.

To each chapter, we tried to put some benefits and cons using or not using each measurement. Ultimately, this document should serve many purposes: learning and teaching, helping in the presales process or preparing a refactoring plan for our clients.
