# Isolated component development

Developing components in isolation allows you to play around with components independently from the rest of your app. You can tweak the state, see how the component behaves under different circumstances. You can test it easily. And mostly you are not dependant on other dependencies and can showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.

This reduces complexity, removes inconsistency and provides an amazing onboarding for new developers on a project. Also, it provides a much easier testability of components. Last but not least, it serves as UI documentation called as a styleguide of your app.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is a development environment for UI components, that helps to browse the component library, view the different states, and interactively develop & test.

Storybook is all about writing stories. A story usually contains a single state of one component, almost like a visual test case.

It’s one of the most exciting tools to work with! It improves your performance, with a lot of [add-ons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/) it takes your component development on another level. It helps you to write bulletproof components.

Isolation itself also helps to collaborate in a team. You can have a dedicated UI team working on different stories. When for example the UX team is taking care of their integration. Also, it’s much easier to pair with testers and implementing their test cases.

You should consider using Storybook even when you work alone on a project. When you will get used to it, you will realize that you are actually developing faster. And with better quality.
