# Code versioning flow

Good git practices, meaningful commit messages, branch strategies, pull request templates. All of these improves efficiency and consistency. Also, it’s very helpful for onboarding.

Community standard is a git-flow which is embracing to do a semantic release. We recommend to use it on larger projects.

But overall [be a good “commitzen”](code-quality-tools.md#commitlint) and use [Code quality tools](code-quality-tools.md). They will help to establish nice and easy to follow commit history.
